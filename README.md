pyPLUTO 
=========

Python scripts for Visualization of [PLUTO code](https://github.com/black-hole-group/pluto) data.

The code is completely written using the Python Language. 
Further the GUI is developed with the Tkinter Interface.

# Features

1. Completely based on Python and easy to work without need of any licenses like in IDL. 
2. The GUI environment provides a tool for quick-check of data during the simulations runs. 
3. The code is user friendly and allows the user to even do further plotting of contours, velocity vectors on the surface plot.
4. Also the code can read the saved user defined variables. 

# Limitations

1. Only 2D views are available for 3D data. 
2. The code up-till now only has visualization tools for static data. The AMR data can not be viewed with the same. 
3. ~~Only compatible with Python 2. Ongoing effort to port it to Python 3 in branch `py3` in this repo.~~
